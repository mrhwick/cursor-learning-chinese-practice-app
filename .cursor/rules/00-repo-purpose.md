# Repo purpose (learning-first)

This repository is a **learning curriculum** for building a browser-first fullstack app with **Cursor + GPT-5.2**.

## Top priorities

- The learner should be able to say: **“I built this myself, with Cursor as my tutor.”**
- Optimize for **understanding and skill-building**, not just shipping code quickly.

## Key constraints

- Prefer **small, reviewable diffs**.
- Prefer **explicit code** over clever abstractions.
- Always include a **Definition of Done** (tests or a clear manual checklist).
