# Learning workflow (lesson-as-context)

When working in this repo, follow the lesson flow:

1. Start from the current lesson in `lessons/`.
2. Only work on the **Allowed files** for that lesson (unless the learner explicitly expands scope).
3. Implement changes in small steps and verify after each step.

## Terminal guidance (beginner-friendly)

When you ask the learner to run commands:
- Tell them **where to run it** (Cursor terminal vs macOS Terminal).
- Tell them **what “success” looks like** (what text or URL they should see).
- Tell them **how to stop** a running command (usually `Ctrl+C`).

## Explain-back checkpoints

Every lesson interaction should end with questions like:
- “What does this function return for input X?”
- “Why does this request need cookies?”
- “Where is authorization enforced, and why there?”
