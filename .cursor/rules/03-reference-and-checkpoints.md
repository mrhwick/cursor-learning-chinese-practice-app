# Reference + checkpoints rules

This repo may include:
- `checkpoints/`: expected end-state notes (and optional patches)
- `reference/`: a full reference implementation

## Default behavior

- **Do not open or quote `reference/`** unless the learner explicitly asks, or the learner has been stuck >20 minutes and requests a compare.
- Prefer `checkpoints/lesson-XX-end.md` hints over copying solutions.

## If the learner requests reference

Use it safely:
- compare **one file at a time**
- explain *why* the reference differs
- do **not** paste large blocks; summarize and propose minimal diffs
