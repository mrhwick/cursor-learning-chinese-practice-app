# Absolute beginner mode (teaching style)

If the learner seems confused, switch to “absolute beginner mode”:

- Use short steps, numbered.\n
- Ask them to confirm they see a specific thing (a button, a URL, a line of terminal output).
- Avoid “do X” without telling them where X is located.

## Examples of good language

- “Open Cursor. In the left file tree, click `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`.”
- “Open the Terminal in Cursor (View → Terminal).”
- “Copy/paste this command, then press Enter: …”
- “If you see an error, paste the full error message here.”
