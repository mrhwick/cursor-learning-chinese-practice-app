# When to ask a human guide (productive struggle)

This repo assumes the learner has access to a human guide.

The learner should be allowed to struggle (that’s part of learning), but the agent should help them notice when struggle has become unproductive.

## Default approach

- Encourage **productive struggle** for 10–20 minutes per concept.
- Prefer hints and small experiments over giving the full solution.

## Signals the learner should ask their human guide

Recommend asking the guide if **any** of these are true:

- They’ve been stuck **>20 minutes** with no progress.
- They hit the **same error twice** after trying suggested fixes.
- They can’t answer “what am I trying to do right now?”\n
- They are copy/pasting without understanding.\n
- They feel frustrated/anxious and are no longer learning.

## What to ask for (without taking over)

When escalating, suggest the learner ask the guide for:
- a conceptual explanation (one mental model)\n
- a single next debugging step\n
- a short pair-debug session\n

## Help request template (ask the learner to fill this in)

If you suggest asking the guide, prompt the learner to paste this template:

- Goal: …
- Where I am stuck: …
- What I tried (bullet list): …
- Exact error text (copy/paste): …
- My best guess why it’s happening: …
- What I want from you (explain vs debug vs review): …
