# Checkpoints

Checkpoints are “expected end states” for lessons.

This repo uses **notes** checkpoints by default (small, readable, low-maintenance).

Optional extension:
- add patch files like `checkpoints/lesson-03-end.patch` for faster comparison

## How to use

1) Attempt the lesson first.\n
2) Verify the Definition of Done.\n
3) If stuck, read the corresponding checkpoint notes.\n
4) Only then compare to `reference/` (small diffs only).
