# Absolute beginner guide (start here if you’re new)

If you’ve never coded before, start here.

## What is this repo?

- A **repo** (repository) is a folder containing code and instructions.
- This repo teaches you (with Cursor) to build a real app.

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is an editor (like a fancy text editor) that can also act like a tutor via AI chat.

## What is a “Terminal”?

A **terminal** is a window where you type commands and press Enter.

You can use:
- **Cursor’s Terminal** (recommended): inside Cursor (View → Terminal)
- **macOS Terminal**: built-in app (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)

## Running commands safely

- Copy/paste commands exactly.\n
- Run commands **one at a time**.\n
- If something fails, copy the full error message.

## How to stop something that’s “running”

If a command is running and you want to stop it, click the terminal and press:
- `Ctrl+C`

## What are “prereqs”?

Prereqs are tools your computer must install before the code can run (like installing a game before playing it).

In this repo we use:
- **Node.js**: runs the web dev tools (React/Vite)
- **Python**: runs the backend API (FastAPI)

Now go to `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` and follow it step-by-step.
