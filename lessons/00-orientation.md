## Lesson 00: Orientation (learning with Cursor)

### Goal
Be able to:
- run the app locally
- make a tiny change and see it in the browser
- ask Cursor for a plan + an explanation

### Allowed files
- `docs/CURSOR_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `apps/web/src/ui/App.tsx`

### Definition of Done
- You can run `./scripts/dev.sh` and open `http://localhost:5173`
- You made a small UI text change and can explain how it got there

## Agent Contract (paste into Cursor chat)
You are my coding tutor inside Cursor.

Rules:
- Ask 1–3 clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous.
- Prefer small steps. After each step, tell me what changed and why.
- Don’t skip explanations; explain code in plain language.
- End by asking me 2 questions to check understanding.

## Tasks

1) Run the repo:
- follow `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`
- run `./scripts/dev.sh`

2) In `apps/web/src/ui/App.tsx`, change the subtitle text to include your name.

3) Ask Cursor:
- “Explain what Vite is doing for me here.”
- “How is the UI talking to the API?”
