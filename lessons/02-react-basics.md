## Lesson 02: React basics (components + state)

### Goal
Practice component decomposition and state:
- extract a component
- pass props
- keep state local where possible

### Allowed files
- `apps/web/src/ui/App.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/ui/PhraseCard.tsx`

### Definition of Done
- You can explain:
  - what a component is
  - what props are
  - what state is
- You made one small UI improvement (your choice) and can justify it

---

## Suggested tasks

1) Ask Cursor to explain `PhraseCard` in plain English.\n
2) Add a “collapse/expand submissions” toggle inside `PhraseCard`.\n
3) Explain-back questions:\n
- What state lives in `App` vs `PhraseCard`, and why?\n
- What would break if you removed `credentials: "include"`?
