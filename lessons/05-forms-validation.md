## Lesson 05: Forms + validation

### Goal
Practice the full loop:
UI form → API request → validation → success/error UI.

### Allowed files
- `apps/web/src/ui/App.tsx`
- `apps/api/chinese_practice/schemas.py`
- `apps/api/chinese_practice/main.py`

### Definition of Done
- You can intentionally trigger a validation error and see a helpful message in the UI.

## Tasks

1) Make the “Create phrase” form show a friendly error if the API returns 400.\n
2) Ask Cursor:\n
- “Where are we validating phrase length, and why is it good to validate on the server?”\n
3) Explain-back:\n
- What happens if we validate only on the UI and not on the API?
