## Lesson 06: Authentication (signup/login/logout)

### Goal
Understand sessions and why we use cookies for this app.

### Allowed files
- `apps/api/chinese_practice/main.py`
- `apps/api/chinese_practice/auth.py`
- `apps/web/src/ui/App.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/api/client.ts`

### Definition of Done
- You can sign up, log out, and log in again.
- You can explain where the “logged in” state actually lives (browser cookie + server session).

## Explain-back questions
- What does `credentials: "include"` do?
- What’s the difference between authentication and authorization?
