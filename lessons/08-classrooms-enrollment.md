## Lesson 08: Classrooms + enrollment

### Goal
Build the multi-user “class” concept:
- teacher creates a classroom
- students join via invite code
- content is scoped to the classroom

### Allowed files
- `apps/api/chinese_practice/main.py`
- `apps/web/src/ui/App.tsx`

### Definition of Done
- You can create a classroom, copy the invite code, and join from another account.
- After joining, you can see the classroom’s phrases.

## Explain-back questions
- What table represents membership?\n
- Why do we check enrollment before serving phrases/audio?
