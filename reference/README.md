# Reference implementation

This folder contains a **reference implementation** of the capstone app.

It exists so the learner can:
- compare after attempting a lesson
- debug by diffing a small area
- learn alternative design choices

Do not start by copying this.

See `docs/REFERENCE_USAGE.md`.

## Structure

- `reference/apps/api`
- `reference/apps/web`

These mirror the learner app structure under `apps/`.
